	In the default Riot project setup there a two different DispatcherServlets.
	One that handles public request (usually mapped to *.html) and another one
	that provides the Riot admin user-interface (mapped to /riot/*).
	</p>
	<p>
	When working with components, the Riot servlet needs to access some of 
	the beans defined in the website-servlet's context. More precisely it needs 
	to look up all ComponentListControllers and of course the ComponentRepository. 
	Additionally it must obtain a reference	to the website's cache instance in 
	order to invalidate cache items when components are published.
