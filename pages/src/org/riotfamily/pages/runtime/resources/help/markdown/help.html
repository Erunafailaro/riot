<h1>Links</h1>
<p>
	For a URL or email, just write it like this:
</p>
<p>
	<code>
		<http://someurl>
		<somebbob@example.com>
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	To use text for the link, write it <code>[like this](http://someurl)</code>.
</p>

<h1>Text</h1>
<p>
	Use <code>*</code> or <code>_</code> to emphasize things:
</p>
<p>
	<code>
		*this is in italic*  and _so is this_

		**this is in bold**  and __so is this__

		***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___
	</code>
</p>


<h1>Blockquotes</h1>
<p>
	Use the <code>></code> character in front of a line, just like in email.
	Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.
	To end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following paragraph.
</p>

<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>
	* an asterisk starts an unordered list
	* and this is another item in the list
	+ or you can also use the + character
	- or the - character
</p>
<p>
	To start an ordered list, write this:
</p>
<p>
	1. this starts a list *with* numbers
	+  this will show as number "2"
	*  this will show as number "3."
	9. any number, +, -, or * will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level
</p>      
        
Headers
---------

This is a huge header
==================

this is a smaller header
------------------

Just put 1 or more dashes or equals signs (--- or ===) below the title.

You might use the huge header at the very top of your text for a title or
something (except weblog posts usually already have a title), and use the
smaller header for subtitles or sections.


Horizontal Rule
---------------

just put three or more *'s or -'s on a line:

----------------

or you can use single spaces between then, like this:

* * *

or 

- - - - - - - 

Make sure you have a blank line above the dashes, though, or else:

you will get a header
--- 


Escapes
---------

What if you want to just show asterisks, not italics?

* this shows up in italics: *a happy day*
* this shows the asterisks: \*a happy day\*

The backslashes will disappear and leave the asterisks.

You can do the same with any of the characters that have a special meaning
for Markdown.
