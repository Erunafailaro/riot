Riot Project Skeleton
=====================

Skeleton for new Riot projects. To set up a new project from scratch do the 
following steps:


1) Create an empty project folder

   Well, it does not really need to be empty. If you use an IDE to create a new
   project just make sure that the directory names match the skeleton layout.


2) Invoke the skeleton target

   Use Ant to invoke the 'skeleton' target of the build.xml file contained in
   the same directory as the README you are currently reading. You have to pass
   the directory you just created as command line property:
   
   #$ ant skeleton -Dprefix=/path/to/new_project
   
   Depending on your IDE you might need to refresh your workspace after 
   completion.
   

3) Configure your project

   Refer to the README file in the /conf directory of the newly created project.
