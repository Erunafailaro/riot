Overview

Riot is a framework that extends the Spring/Hibernate stack to build websites
with content management support.

It allows you to create beautifully looking admin-interfaces without having to
write any code. Instead of just *scaffolding* a basic CRUD interface, Riot lets
you to define your UI without adding dependencies to your code.

In addition to this back-office view, Riot also supports in-place editing 
that allows you to edit content directly on the website, right where it is 
displayed.

This feature is based on Riot's content-model, which allows you to store 
arbitrary schema-less data.

Besides that, Riot comes with a bunch of useful tools to solve common tasks like
dynamic headline image generation, CSS and JavaScript minification, 
template inheritance and much more.
