==============
Active Records
==============

Riot encourages the use of the active record pattern and therefore provides the
necessary infrastructure.

Using this pattern allows you to write applications with a rich domain model
that is aware of the persistence layer::

	Cat cat = new Cat();
	cat.setColor("black");
	cat.save();

In order to look up ActiveRecords, you simply add static finder methods to
your entities. Such a finder method allows you to write code like this::

	List<Cat> blackCats = Cat.findByColor("black");

The ActiveRecord base-class provides a protected static method to write such 
finders::

	public static List<Post> findByColor(String color) {
	    return query(Cat.class, "from {} where color = ?", color).find();
	}
	
All occurrences of the ``{}`` token in the HQL string will be replaced by the
actual entity name of the given class, making it more refactoring-safe.
