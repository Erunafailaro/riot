.. highlight:: ftl

Riot allows you to assemble pages from smaller re-usable blocks, so-called 
components. A component may be virtually anything. From simple elements like
headlines or paragraphs to more complex templates like teaser boxes, forms,
media galleries or completely dynamic content.

Components are contained in lists and may be re-arranged using drag-and-drop.
You can define a component list using a FreeMarker macro:: 

    <@inplace.componentList key="components" valid=["headline","paragraph"] />

The first thing you need to specify is the key under which the list should be
stored in the :ref:`content <content>` map.

Next you specify a list of component-types that may be inserted. For each 
component a FreeMarker file must be created under
:file:`WEB-INF/view/components/{<component-type>}.ftl`. Here's an example for
a simple headline component::

    <#---
    @name Heading
    @icon text_heading_1
    -->
    <h1>Headline</h1>
    
The leading comment block may contain fmdoc annotations to define a 
human-friendly name and an icon which both will be displayed in the 
*insert component* menu.

.. note:: The *@icon* annotation may refer to one of the 
    `700+ items <http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/previews/index_abc.png>`_
    from the `Silk <http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/>`_ icon-set.

The example above isn't really useful yet as it always displays the same static
text. In order to make the text editable we have to replace the hard-coded
``h1`` tag with an inplace macro::

    <#---
    @name Heading
    @icon text_heading_1
    -->
    <@inplace.text key="headline" tag="h1">Headline</@inplace.text>
