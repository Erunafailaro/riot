   back-office
      Common term for the Riot admin interface. Authorized users can access the
      back-office by pointing their browser to ``/riot``.
      
   front-office
      Another term for viewing the website in :term:`edit-mode`.
      
   edit-mode
      When browsing the website while being logged in at the 
      :term:`back-office`, Riot displays a :term:`toolbar` which allows users to
      edit the content right :term:`in-place`.
      
   toolbar
      The Riot toolbar provides a set of tools that can be used to edit content
      :term:`in-place`. There are tools to insert or remove components, 
      to re-order components by dragging them around, to edit text or the to
      modify arbitrary content properties.
      
   in-place
      In-place (or inplace) editing means that content is edited directly on the
      website, right where it is displayed. This is the opposite of
      :term:`back-office` editing, hence this view is often referred to as 
      :term:`front-office`.
      
   root-page
      The :term:`page` mapped to ``/``. Every :term:`site` has exactly one
      root-page. The only difference to other pages is that a root-page has
      no :term:`path-component`.
      
   path-component
      String that together with other path-components makes up a path. The 
      complete path is assembled by joining all its components (separated by 
      slashes) and optionally adding an extension.
      Given a path like ``/foo/bar.html``, both ``foo`` and ``bar`` are 
      path-components.
