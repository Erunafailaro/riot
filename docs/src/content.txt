Content
-------

A *Content* is basically a persistent Map with String keys and arbitrary values.
Riot uses the :api:`org.riotfamily.components.model.Content` class to store 
schema-less, versioned content in a RDBMS.

In order to support versioning, Content can be put into a 
:api:`org.riotfamily.components.model.ContentContainer`
which keeps a reference to a live- and a preview-version.
