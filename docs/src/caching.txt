Caching
=======

Riot uses a sophisticated caching concept that reduces the number of database 
queries to the absolute minimum. Unless you update the content on your site, 
Riot won't hit the database at all.

Riot doesn't cache Java objects, it caches the final output. This can be HTML,
XML, JSON or any other kind of content such as images or PDFs.

Spring-MVC
==========

The Riot cache integrates with Spring's MVC and allows you to cache the
output of handlers. A handler can either be a class that implements the 
:api:`org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller` interface or a class 
that has methods annotated with :api:`org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.@RequestMapping`.

Caching Controllers
-------------------

In order to cache a Controller, it must implement the 
:api:`org.riotfamily.common.web.cache.controller.CacheableController` interface.

Caching @RequestMapping methods
-------------------------------

To cache annotation-based handlers, add the 
:api:`org.riotfamily.common.web.cache.annotation.@Cache` annotation to your 
handler method::

	@Cache
	@RequestMapping
	public void time(Writer out) throws Exception {
		out.write(String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()));
	}

.. _transparent-cache-invalidation:

Transparent Invalidation
========================

The most exciting feature is the transparent cache invalidation. Riot
automatically invalidates cached content whenever the underlying data is
modified.

Two hooks are used internally to achieve this:

First, Riot uses a Hibernate interceptor to get notified when data is loaded,
deleted or modified.

Second, FreeMarker's ObjectWrapper facility is used to detect whenever cacheable
data is accessed inside a view. 

To use this feature, simply add the @TagCacheItems annotation to your entities.


Performance
===========

In order to keep the memory footprint low, the cached objects are stored in the
local file system and are streamed to the client when needed (Riot relies on 
the operating system's file system cache to reduce the actual disk access).
