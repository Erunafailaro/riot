Admin Interface
===============

One of Riot's core features is the admin interface, which is often also 
referred to as :term:`back-office`.

It consists of different *screens* that are organized in a hierarchical way.
Riot comes with three built-in screen types: groups, lists and forms. Of course
you are free to create your own screen types if needed.


Lists
=====

List screens allow you to browse or search your data and can be used to add
new content.

.. highlight:: xml

Let's start with an example::

    <s:list id="blogPosts" icon="newspaper">
        <s:dao>
            <bean class="org.riotfamily.core.dao.hibernate.HqlDao" autowire="constructor"
                p:entityClass="eg.example.BlogPost" 
                p:search="title" />
        </s:dao>
        <s:columns>
            <s:column property="title" />
            <s:column property="author.name" />
        </s:columns>
    </s:list>
    
The declaration above does several things: First, it assigns an ID that can be
used to reference the screen from somewhere else. It also assigns an icon that
will be displayed in the breadcrumb navigation. Next, it defines a DAO that is
used to retrieve the list items. And finally it defines what columns should be
displayed.
