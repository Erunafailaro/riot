Admin Interface
===============

One of Riot's core features is the admin interface, which is often also 
referred to as :term:`back-office`.

It consists of different *screens* that are organized in a hierarchical way.
Riot comes with three built-in screen types: groups, lists and forms. Of course
you are free to create your own screen types if needed.

Lists
=====

List screens allow you to browse or search your data and can be used to add
new content.
