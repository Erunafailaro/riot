Provides classes to display status messages.
<h2>Sample usecase</h2>
<p>
Website users can submit user-generated content. Before the content is displayed
on the website, an administrator needs to review the submissions.
</p>
<p>
A StatusMonitor can be added to the riot-servlet context that checks whether
there are pending submissions. If there is any content that needs to be approved,
a message is displayed, containing the number of submissions and a link to the
appropriate Riot list.
