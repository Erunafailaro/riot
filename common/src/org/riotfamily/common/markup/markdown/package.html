<p>
	The classes in this package are taken from the 
	<a href="http://markdownj.petebevin.com/">MarkdownJ</a> package, a Java port
	of the original <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Markdown</a>
	code by John Gruber. Since most methods are declared private in MarkdownJ
	they were repackaged in oder to add additional features.
</p>
<p>
	Local links are now rewritten to support URL-based session tracking.
	Additionally the context path is added to context-relative URLs.
	Another new feature is Textile/SmartyPants-like glyph-replacment for
	quotes, dashes and other special characters.
